    "bio": "Poland’s first multi-time world champion and now a five-time winner of the Speedway GP World Championship, Bartosz Zmarzlik is making a career out of rewriting the history books. Zmarzlik was schooled at his local club Gorzow, racing with Polish great Tomasz Gollob in his early years. But the pupil is now the master. Since joining the series full-time for 2016, Bartek has amassed an astonishing eight FIM Speedway World Championship medals in nine years, winning gold in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024, silver in 2018 and 2021 and bronze in 2016. He won an incredible five rounds from the nine he raced in 2023 and sealed gold with an unforgettable win at Torun's Marian Rose Motoarena - a victory that saw him match Aussie legend Jason Crump's all-time series record of 23 wins. He smashed that record with victory at the 3P Logistics FIM Speedway GP of Sweden - Malilla on June 15, before extending it with wins in Riga and Torun in the closing rounds of 2024. Zmarzlik cemented his spot among the sport's greats by sealing his fifth Speedway GP world title in Vojens on September 14 - becoming only the second rider in history after New Zealand legend Ivan Mauger to win gold three years in a row. He bids to match Mauger and Swedish great Tony Rickardsson's all-time record haul of six world titles in 2025.",

His progress was slowed by injuries that ended both his 2022 and 2023 seasons early, with Thomsen losing his spot in Speedway GP at the end of 2023. But he bounced back in fine style in 2024, winning his third Danish Championship and racing into the top 10 in Poland's PGE Ekstraliga averages for Stal Gorzow. Thomsen crowned a strong season by finishing second at the 2024 FIM SGP Challenge in Pardubice to secure an immediate return to Speedway GP for 2025.",
